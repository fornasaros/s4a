This repository contains the R-script for the analysis described in the paper "Label-free analysis of gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) by surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)".

Thie script was used to process surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectral data using the [hyperSpec](http://cbeleites.github.io/hyperSpec/) package.
